SPEAKEASY MR SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

Your scene has been reorganized with a cleaner hierarchy, but there are still a few manual steps you need to complete:

1. VoiceCommandManager Setup:
   - The VoiceCommandSystem GameObject already has your Wit configuration
   - Make sure the VoiceCommandManager script is attached to it
   - Connect the AudioSource component to the feedbackAudioSource field in VoiceCommandManager

2. Canvas Setup:
   - Ensure TherapyCanvas has:
     - Canvas component (set to World Space)
     - CanvasScaler component
     - GraphicRaycaster component
   - Each panel should have a CanvasGroup component
   - All text elements should be TextMeshPro objects

3. Component References:
   - Select the SessionController GameObject
   - In the inspector, drag the VoiceCommandSystem to the "voiceManager" field
   - Drag the TherapyCanvas to the "uiController" field
   
   - Select the KeyboardInputDebugger GameObject
   - Drag the VoiceCommandSystem to the "voiceManager" field

4. Set Up Therapy Steps:
   - Select the SessionController GameObject
   - In the Inspector, expand the "Therapy Steps" array
   - Add at least 4 steps with names, instructions, and durations

5. Fix Unity Namespaces Issues:
   - Ensure all scripts are in the proper namespaces:
     - VoiceCommandManager should be in "SpeakEasy.VoiceControl"
     - SessionController should be in "SpeakEasy.Therapy"
     - UIController should be in "SpeakEasy.UI"

After completing these steps, your scene should work properly with the voice commands!
