# Implementation Notes

## Core Architecture

The voice-driven MR accessibility prototype is built around a few key components:

1. **VoiceCommandManager**: Central component that interfaces with Wit.ai to process voice commands.
2. **SessionController**: Manages the therapy/creative session flow and states.
3. **FeedbackManager**: Provides multi-modal feedback to the user.
4. **PrivacySettings**: Handles user privacy preferences.

## Voice Recognition Implementation Details

### Command Processing Flow

1. User speaks a command
2. Wit.ai captures and processes the audio
3. Intent and confidence are determined
4. If confidence exceeds threshold, command is accepted
5. Appropriate action is taken based on the intent
6. Feedback is provided to the user

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Low Confidence**: If confidence is below threshold but still recognizable, user is asked to repeat
- **Unrecognized Command**: If intent doesn't match any expected command, suggestions are provided
- **Multiple Failed Attempts**: After 3 failed attempts, system suggests alternative commands
- **Timeout**: If no command is detected for a defined period, system provides a prompt and eventually auto-advances

## Accessibility Considerations

### Speech Pattern Accommodation

- Support for varied speech patterns through broad intent training
- Configurable confidence thresholds to accommodate different speech abilities
- Multiple command variations for each action

### Multi-Modal Feedback

- Visual feedback (text, color changes)
- Audio feedback (success/error sounds)
- Status indicators show system state
- All critical information conveyed through multiple channels

### Timing and Pacing

- Configurable timeout duration
- Auto-advance feature for users who may struggle with consistent commands
- Clear status indicators for system state

## Privacy Implementation

### Local Processing

- Option to use on-device processing when available
- Clear indicators when processing is happening locally vs. in the cloud
- Default to most private option when available

### Data Handling

- User control over data sharing
- Clear explanation of what data is collected
- Option to delete session data

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Voice Recognition Accuracy

**Solution**: 
- Extensive training of the Wit.ai model
- Implementation of synonym detection for commands
- Confidence threshold adjustment based on testing
- Retry logic with helpful feedback

### Challenge: Maintaining User Autonomy

**Solution**:
- Auto-advance is optional and has a long timeout
- User can always manually navigate
- Clear indicators of system state and expectations
- No forced progression without user acknowledgment

### Challenge: Balancing Privacy and Performance

**Solution**:
- Optional local processing when available
- Transparency about processing location
- Minimal data collection by default
- User-controlled privacy settings

## Meta SDK Building Blocks Usage

The following Meta SDK Building Blocks are recommended for this implementation:

1. **Voice Service Block**: Provides pre-configured Wit.ai integration
2. **UI Panel Block**: For accessible interface elements
3. **Audio Feedback Block**: For consistent audio cues
4. **Interaction Hint Block**: To provide guidance on available commands

## Performance Optimization

- Voice processing is the most resource-intensive component
- Local processing reduces latency but may impact battery life
- UI elements use TextMeshPro for optimal rendering
- Audio feedback uses pooled AudioSource components for efficiency

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Expanded Command Set**: Add more domain-specific commands
2. **Voice Response Synthesis**: Add spoken feedback to complete the voice interaction loop
3. **Personalization**: Allow for user-specific command training
4. **Multimodal Input**: Optional combination with eye tracking or simple gesture recognition
5. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjusting session complexity based on user performance
